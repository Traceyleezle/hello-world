# hello-world
No clue what I am doing here. Hoping to fix that.
I'm 36. I'm bored with being an administrative assistant. I have always found coding fascinating and want to learn to code myself. I'm not entirely sure that I want to learn front end languages, the back end coding languages sound more interesting. However, I'm just dicking around, getting started, so we shall see where this journey lands me in the end.
